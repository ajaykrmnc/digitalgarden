## Why This Project?

I believe in starting mornings with meaningful reading rather than doomscrolling through social media. My Kindle provides the perfect distraction-free environment for consuming quality content. This project automates the delivery of curated news and articles to my Kindle every morning.

## Learning By Doing

This project embodies my philosophy of learning programming by applying it to real problems. Instead of just reading tutorials, I built something useful while picking up new skills along the way.

### What I'm Sending to Kindle

- **Tech News**: Latest from the technology world
- **Finance Updates**: Market insights and financial news
- **National News**: Current affairs and editorials
- **Articles**: Long-form content from various sources

All delivered in clean, readable epub format optimized for e-ink displays.

## Technologies & Concepts Learned

- **Calibre**: E-book management and format conversion
- **SMTP Server**: Email-based Kindle delivery
- **Cron Jobs & GitHub Actions**: Automated scheduling
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting content from websites
- **HTML Parsing**: Processing web content
- **Tampermonkey**: Browser automation scripts

- **RSS Feeds**: Standardized content syndication
- **EPUB Formatting**: E-book structure and styling
- **Gemini AI**: AI-powered content generation
- **readability.js**: Content extraction library
