## The State of Engineering Education in India

India has a staggering **8876 Engineering colleges**, with approximately one-third being government-run institutions. The funding disparity is notable:
- **IIT funding**: 8132 crores
- **NIT funding**: 3200 crores

### Post-COVID Placement Reality

The placement scenario has seen a significant decline after COVID, with a **10-15% decline in average packages**. Taking IIT Dhanbad as an example:
- Total students: ~8000
- Placement rate: 60-70%

### The Innovation Paradox

There's a concerning trend where students are primarily focused on securing jobs rather than nation-building and innovation. The mindset is more about personal career growth than contributing to India's technological advancement.

## Startups by IITians

Despite the job-focused mentality, some notable startups have emerged from IIT alumni:
- **Postman** - API development platform
- **Browserstack** - Cross-browser testing
- **Rubrik** - Cloud data management
- **Rippling** - HR and IT management

## AI Development in India

The AI landscape in India presents an interesting contrast. **Krutrim AI** represents India's efforts in the AI space, but when compared to China's **Deepseek**, the gap becomes evident.

Sam Altman's controversial remark calling India's AI prospects "Totally hopeless" sparked debate about India's position in the global AI race.

## The Brain Drain Reality

Many companies founded by Indians are headquartered outside India:
- **Rubrik** - Founded by Bipul Sinha
- **Rippling** - Founded by Parker Conrad and Prasanna Sankar
- **Nutanix** - Founded by Dheeraj Pandey
- **Glean** - Founded by Arvind Jain

This raises questions about why Indian entrepreneurs choose to build their companies abroad rather than in India.
