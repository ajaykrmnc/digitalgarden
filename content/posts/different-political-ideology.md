## The Spark of Curiosity

During my Barclays internship, a scenario arose where colleagues were discussing politics. This prompted me to dive deeper into understanding political ideologies.

## Reading About Bose and Beyond

My exploration led me to read about **Subhas Chandra Bose** and various political ideologies that have shaped the modern world.

## Origins: The French Revolution

The terms "left-wing" and "right-wing" originated during the **French Revolution**:
- Those who sat on the **right** of the National Assembly supported the monarchy and traditional institutions
- Those on the **left** supported revolution and change

## The Political Spectrum

### Right Wing
- **Capitalist** economic policies
- Free market advocacy
- Traditional values
- Individual liberty over collective action

### Left Wing
- **Communist/Socialist** leanings
- State intervention in economy
- Focus on equality
- Collective welfare over individual profit

## The Cold War Era

The ideological battle between capitalism and communism defined the 20th century:

### Vietnam War
A proxy war where the United States tried to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, leading to one of the most controversial conflicts in American history.

### The Domino Effect
The theory that if one country fell to communism, neighboring countries would follow like falling dominoes. This fear drove much of American foreign policy.

## Notable Figures and Remarks

### Nixon and Indira Gandhi
The relationship between President Nixon and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was famously tense. Nixon's private remarks about India and Gandhi revealed the geopolitical tensions of that era.

## Socialism vs Communism

While often used interchangeably, there are key differences:

**Socialism**:
- Government ownership of key industries
- Democratic political system possible
- Gradual transition from capitalism

**Communism**:
- Complete state ownership
- Classless society as end goal
- Revolutionary change

Understanding these ideologies helps make sense of current political debates and international relations.
