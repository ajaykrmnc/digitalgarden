## Two Months in Pune

My journey in Pune has been an eventful one, filled with exploration, work, and new experiences.

## Places I've Visited

During my time here, I've explored several destinations:
- **Lonavala** - The famous hill station
- **Sinhagad** - Historic fort with stunning views
- **Swargate** - The bustling commercial area
- **Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati** - The famous temple
- Trips to **Bangalore**, **Kolkata**, and **Dhanbad**

## Living Situation

### From PG to Flat
Started my stay at **Stanza PG**, then shifted to a flat for more independence.
- **Flat rent**: ₹36,000 for a 3BHK

### Daily Commute
- Office is just **3 km away**
- Uber costs between **₹75-100** per ride

## Fitness & Recreation

- **Gym membership**: ₹2,500/month
- **Badminton** at Shivaji Stadium, Balewadi

## Food Scene

The food in Pune has been a highlight:
- **Domino's** for quick bites
- **Dhabeli** - Local favorite
- **Vada Pav** - The quintessential Maharashtra snack
- **PK Biryani** @ ₹192 - Great value!

## Spiritual Spots

Discovered **Tukai Devi Mandir** on Baner Hills - a peaceful retreat from the city bustle.

## Work Life at Arista

### Office Experience
Working at Arista has been a learning curve. The office environment is professional and the work is challenging.

### Team Outing
Had a memorable team outing to **iGolf** - great bonding experience with colleagues.

### Technical Learning
At Arista, I've been diving deep into:
- **Git** - Version control mastery
- **Gerrit** - Code review workflows

## Bangalore Trip Observations

My visit to Bangalore provided interesting comparisons between the two tech cities. The traffic, the startup culture, and the cosmopolitan vibe were quite different from Pune's more relaxed atmosphere.
