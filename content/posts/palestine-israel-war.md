## A Year of Following the Conflict

I've been following the Palestine-Israel war for over a year now, trying to understand the complexities of this long-standing conflict.

### Personal Experience in Liverpool

During my time in Liverpool, I witnessed firsthand the protests and demonstrations related to this conflict. The passion and intensity of people advocating for both sides was palpable on the streets.

## Understanding the Diplomatic Landscape

### The Core Issues
- **Israeli Occupation**: The ongoing territorial disputes
- **Gaza Strip**: A densely populated region under siege
- **West Bank**: Contested territory with settlements

### Key Players

The conflict involves multiple nations and intelligence agencies:
- **United States**: Primary ally of Israel
- **Iran**: Supporting Palestinian resistance groups
- **Mossad**: Israeli intelligence agency
- **Unit 8200**: Israel's elite cyber intelligence unit

## The Human Cost

The devastation in Gaza has been immense:
- **53,000+ killed** since the conflict escalated
- Massive displacement of civilians
- Infrastructure completely destroyed

## How It Began

The current phase of the war began on **October 7, 2023**, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. This triggered a massive Israeli military response that continues to this day.

The conflict raises difficult questions about occupation, resistance, civilian casualties, and the path to peace in a region that has known little of it.
