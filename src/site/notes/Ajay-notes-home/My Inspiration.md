**Life Philosophy**
***
Everyone seeks knowledge to their problems become a good knowledge is solution to every problems. Complete knowledge gives u calmness and incomplete knowledge give u rage, coldness you'll try to become sarcastic.
Everyone should accept however he is this'll make them. so Everyone should love himself.  This is necessary for growth both outward and inward.
