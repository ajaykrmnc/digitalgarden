Here was a scenario, During my internship at Barclays I was sitting with the co-interns and there was a political discussion was going on. Since during those days there was a election in Great Britain also some protest among the black going. They were discussing about left and right wing of politics, and that time I felt how I am dumb that I does not read the newspaper or follow some political ideologies. Another time I felt the same way was when I was reading the book on Bose and there was a chapter named 'Irk of ism' something like that, name is not that important but the gist was whether Bose was fascist or communist or left wing politician or right wing politician.
Ok! Now I should stop yapping about different stories now straight to the point.
