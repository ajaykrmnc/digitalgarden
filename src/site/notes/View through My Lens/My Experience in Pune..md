So It's been 2 months in Pune I went to place like Lonavala, Sinhagad and Swargate and also DagruSeth. In this mean time I've also went to Bangalore, Kolkata, and Dhanbad, then Piro then Back to Pune and Shanivar Vada Tukai mandir. In Lonavala we went to the Bhushi dam,  Karla caves, Lonavala lake, Some dam, and also the Ekvira Mandir in Lonavala. Some Interesting fact about I've realise with Pune is I almost never experience the city life so much so in Pune. Talking about the Living condition I'm currently residing in the PG which is stanza living co-living PG. In almost 15 days I'll be shifting in Flat. My Office is 3 Km away from my PG. Daily I book for the Uber in morning around 9-9:30 am. For mean time I sit with a table in evening with some pg in mates and try to code around 1 hour also daily I'm trying to go the nearby gym. The Gym will cost around 2500 rs per month. Sometimes I also went to the the Badminton to the Shivaji Stadium which is also known as Balewadi Stadium. The Balewadi Stadium is known for it Dangal Movie which is shooting location for this. Also 2010 CommonWealth Game happen over there. Some Football Matches like Pro Kabaddi League also happen there. I can share more facts about my life style like every night I crave for the Dominos and In the evening with pg inamtes I also went for Dabeli and Vada Pav. I almost every day consume atlease one vada Pav. This is something I never experienced with samosas in my home city. For food the PG food is ok sometimes I order from zomato on weekends. There is one biryani shop nearby which is PK Biryani offer very good Biryani @192 rupees. I some initial week I was almost busy with searching for flat finally we've found one flat for with rent for 36000 rent for 3BHK flat. 
Some interesting places I visited is Tukai Devi Mandir over the Baner Hills. Where I found out this was very old Mandir built by Rastrakut over 2500 year ago. Which holds the Baneshwar Mandir where a shiv linga is placed under the rock cutted cave like structure. Talking about the Initial day with Arista. I really like the place I found out the most of developer are very similar to me. Very welcoming and friendly in nature.
